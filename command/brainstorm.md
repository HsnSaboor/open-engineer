# Brainstorm

Use the **brainstormer** agent to turn this idea into a design.

## Input

{{input}}

## Process

1. Check project context (files, docs, recent commits)
2. Ask clarifying questions ONE AT A TIME
3. Propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs
4. Present design in 200-300 word sections, validating each
5. Write final design to `thoughts/shared/designs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`

The design should be clear enough to hand off to `/research` next.
